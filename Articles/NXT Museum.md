During my visit at the NXT museum in Amsterdam, i came across this particular artwork that really struck me, I am and always have been a big fan of projection art, it really helps me to feel like im part of the artwork by having it being projected all around me, the words used by the artist speak to me as well, "I am not an artist, but a traveller"

What makes projection art truly mesmerizing is its ability to engulf spectators in a world of moving pictures. Unlike traditional static artwork, projection art takes advantage of the scale and depth of a given environment to create an immersive encounter. As the projected images come to life, they dance, morph, and evolve in sync with the surrounding architecture, unveiling narratives and evoking emotions that transcend conventional boundaries.

In the realm of projection art, the artist's canvas expands beyond the confines of a frame. Facades of buildings become majestic screens, echoing with stories of the past or visions of the future. Interiors of museums transform into whimsical realms, where visitors find themselves surrounded by an ever-shifting tapestry of colors and forms. Nature's own landscapes become the backdrop for ethereal projections, painting forests, mountains, and bodies of water with radiant light and surreal imagery.

## Notes 
I had made a sketch that showcased the room's setup but i unfortunately lost it in my magnificently huge pile of notes, drawings and sketches. 
The room consisted of 6 beamers if I recall correctly, two for each side, two for the front and 2 for the floor.
the result was that everything in your line of sight became one, every part of your eyes viewed a seamless new world that moved around and evolved infront of you, it kept you hooked in, longing for the unknown, always wondering what's next.

The heat produced by the beamers was unpleasantly immersive as well, the room being hotter than other rooms made it feel like you were truly in a different place where everything felt off from what you are used to. 
Having projection art in modern museums is a very important step to visualizing a new digital world in which we might live one day, it is a window that shows us something we haven't been able to reach before, but feels closer than it ever has been.
