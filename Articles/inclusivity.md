# The Significance of Building an Accessible Application

## Based on the guest lecture given at the AUAS by Cyd Stumpel

Creating an accessible application has become a crucial but somewhat challenging task for developers. An accessible application ensures that people with disabilities can effectively engage with and benefit from the software. To truly understand the needs and challenges of diverse users, it is crucial to test the application with individuals representing various abilities, backgrounds, and perspectives. 

## Inclusivity and Equal Access:
Building an accessible application Should mean that everyone, regardless of their abilities, can use and enjoy the features and functionalities. People with visual impairments, hearing loss, motor disabilities, cognitive limitations, and other disabilities should have equal access to the application's content. By considering the diverse needs of users during development, developers can eliminate barriers and create an inclusive environment.

## Expanding User Base:
Designing an accessible application broadens the potential user base. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 15% of the world's population lives with some form of disability. By catering to their needs, businesses can tap into a significant and important market and increase their user base. Moreover, an accessible application also benefits individuals without disabilities, such as the elderly, those with temporary impairments, or people accessing the application in challenging environments.

## Compliance with Legal and Regulatory Standards:
In many countries, accessibility standards are enshrined in laws and regulations. By developing an accessible application, businesses can comply with these standards and ensure they are not in violation of accessibility requirements. Compliance not only helps avoid legal issues but also demonstrates a commitment to inclusivity and social responsibility.

## Enhanced User Experience:
An accessible application provides an improved user experience for all individuals. By accommodating diverse needs, such as offering alternative input methods, text-to-speech options, or high contrast modes, developers can enhance usability and overall satisfaction. 

## User-Centered Design:
By involving individuals with different abilities and backgrounds in the testing process, developers gain invaluable insights into how the application performs in real-world scenarios. This feedback can help identify and address potential accessibility issues, resulting in a more robust and inclusive final product.

# Conclusion:

Creating an accessible application and testing it with a diverse audience is crucial for developping with inclusivity in mind, expanding the user base, following legal standards, improving user experience, and embracing user-centered design. By prioritizing accessibility, developers can ensure that their software is usable, engaging, and beneficial for people of all abilities. 
Building an accessible application is not just a legal or moral obligation; it is a strategic investment that benefits both businesses and society as a whole.
